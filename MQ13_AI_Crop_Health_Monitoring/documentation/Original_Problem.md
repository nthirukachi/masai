## Capstone Overview

In this capstone, you will build an end-to-end AI pipeline to detect crop stress using multispectral vegetation indices derived from drone imagery. You will train a machine learning model, generate spatial stress maps, and interpret results from an agricultural and drone-operations perspective.

## Dataset Provided

You are provided with a dataset containing vegetation indices such as NDVI, GNDVI, SAVI, EVI, red-edge bands, canopy density, and moisture index. Each row represents a spatial observation within a field. Important: This dataset represents processed multispectral outputs obtained after drone analysis. You are not expected to process raw imagery.

## Objectives

- Understand vegetation indices used in crop health monitoring
- Apply machine learning to classify crop stress
- Perform spatial aggregation for area-level insights
- Interpret AI outputs for drone-based decision making

## Capstone Tasks

### Task 1: Data Understanding
Explore the dataset and explain the role of each vegetation index in detecting crop stress.

### Task 2: Machine Learning Model
Train on multiple classification models and compare between them to predict crop stress. Evaluate using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Justify each classification model

### Task 3: Spatial Analysis & Visualization
Aggregate predictions into grid cells and generate a field-level stress heatmap.

### Task 4: Drone & Agronomy Interpretation
Recommend drone inspection strategies based on stress severity.

### Task 5: Reflection
Discuss limitations and propose improvements using real-world data.

## Deliverable

- Stress maps and visualizations
- Short written explanation (documentation)

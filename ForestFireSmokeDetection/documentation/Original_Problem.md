### Capstone Overview
In this capstone, you will design an end-to-end AI pipeline to detect forest fire and smoke regions from aerial imagery using feature-level analysis. The project emphasizes practical machine learning, robust evaluation, and spatial risk interpretation for drone-based disaster monitoring.

### Dataset Provided
You are provided with a dataset representing tile-level features extracted from aerial imagery. Each row corresponds to a spatial tile with spectral, intensity, and texture-based features relevant to fire or smoke detection. Labels indicate fire/smoke presence.

### Objectives
1. Understand visual indicators of fire and smoke in aerial imagery
2. Apply supervised machine learning for disaster detection
3. Evaluate model reliability using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
4. Perform spatial aggregation and risk visualization
5. Interpret AI outputs for drone-based emergency response

### Capstone Tasks

**Task 1: Data Understanding**
Explore the dataset and explain the relevance of each feature to fire or smoke detection.

**Task 2: Machine Learning Model**
Train a classifier and evaluate it using precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.

**Task 3: Spatial Risk Analysis & Visualization**
Aggregate predictions spatially and generate fire-risk heatmaps.

**Task 4: Drone & Disaster Response Interpretation**
Recommend drone deployment strategies based on predicted risk.

**Task 5: Reflection**
Discuss dataset limitations and potential improvements.

### Deliverables
- Code and its outputs
- Fire/smoke risk heatmaps
- Short technical interpretation report

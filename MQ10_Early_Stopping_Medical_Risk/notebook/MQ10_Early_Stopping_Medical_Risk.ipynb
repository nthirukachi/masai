                "- **What**: Train an AI to detect breast cancer from medical data without \"memorizing\" the answers.\n",
                "- **Why**: If a model simply memorizes the training data (overfitting), it will fail when it sees a new patient. In medicine, this could mean missing a diagnosis.\n",
                "- **Real-World Relevance**: Medical AI systems MUST be robust. They cannot afford to only work on data they've seen before.\n",

                "3.  **Build Model**: Create a brain with 2 hidden layers.\n",
                "4.  **Add Protections**: Add **Weight Decay** (Simplicity Rule) and **Early Stopping** (Stop when not learning).\n",
                "5.  **Train**: Run the training loop.\n",
                "6.  **Evaluate**: See the results.\n",

                "- The Validation AUC (Accuracy) should be high (> 0.95).\n",

# MQ10: Early Stopping & Regularization for Medical Risk Classification

## 🏥 Project Overview
This project teaches two critical concepts in Machine Learning: **Early Stopping** and **Regularization** (Weight Decay). We use a **Medical Risk Classifier** (using the Breast Cancer dataset) to demonstrate how these techniques prevent "overfitting" (like memorizing answers instead of understanding the subject).

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand **Overfitting**: Why models perform well on training data but fail on new data.
- Learn **Early Stopping**: How to automatically stop training when the model stops improving.
- Learn **Weight Decay (L2 Regularization)**: How to keep the model simple and robust.
- Build a pipeline with **feature standardization** and **stratified splitting**.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `notebook/`: Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step teaching explanations.
- `src/`: Complete Python source code.
- `documentation/`: Detailed concept explanations, problem statements, and interview/exam prep.
- `slides/`: Presentation slides for quick revision.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd c:\masai\MQ10_Early_Stopping_Medical_Risk
   ```
2. Run the script using `uv`:
   ```bash
   uv run python src/MQ10_Early_Stopping_Medical_Risk.py
   ```

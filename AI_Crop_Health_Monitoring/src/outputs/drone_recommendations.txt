==================================================

STRESS CATEGORY DISTRIBUTION:
stress_category
Low (Healthy)    735
Critical         361
High              57
Medium            47


Based on the stress analysis, here are the recommended drone actions:

🔴 CRITICAL STRESS AREAS (Probability > 75%):
   - Immediate detailed inspection required
   - Collect close-up imagery for diagnosis
   - Priority: HIGH - inspect within 24 hours
   - Action: Low-altitude multispectral + RGB capture

🟠 HIGH STRESS AREAS (Probability 50-75%):
   - Schedule inspection within 3 days
   - Monitor for progression
   - Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH
   - Action: Standard multispectral survey

🟡 MEDIUM STRESS AREAS (Probability 25-50%):
   - Include in routine weekly surveys
   - Mark for continued monitoring
   - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Action: Regular monitoring flight

🟢 LOW STRESS / HEALTHY AREAS (Probability < 25%):
   - Standard bi-weekly monitoring
   - No immediate action needed
   - Priority: LOW
   - Action: Routine surveillance only

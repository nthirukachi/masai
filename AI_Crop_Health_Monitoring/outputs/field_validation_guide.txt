FIELD VALIDATION GUIDE
======================

PURPOSE:
This file contains sample locations for ground truth validation.
Visit each location and record the actual crop health status.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIELD TEAM:
1. Use GPS to navigate to each (grid_x, grid_y) location
2. Visually assess the crop health
3. Fill in the 'actual_health_status' column:
   - 'Healthy' if plants appear vigorous and green
   - 'Stressed' if plants show wilting, discoloration, or disease

4. Add notes about what you observe (pest damage, water stress, etc.)
5. Take photos and record the photo ID

VALIDATION METRICS:
After completing field work, compare:
- Model's 'predicted_label' vs your 'actual_health_status'
- Calculate: Accuracy = (matching predictions / total samples) × 100

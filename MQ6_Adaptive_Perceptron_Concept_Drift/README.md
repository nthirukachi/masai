# MQ6: Adaptive Perceptron for Data Stream with Concept Drift

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build an **Adaptive Perceptron** capable of handling **Concept Drift** in a data stream.
It is designed as a **Teaching Project** for beginners to understand:
- What Concept Drift is.
- Why static models fail on changing data.
- How to implement adaptive learning rates and weight resets.
- How to evaluate models on streaming data.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`notebook/`**: Jupyter Notebooks for teaching and experimentation.
- **`src/`**: Python source code for the adaptive perceptron.
- **`documentation/`**: Detailed explanations, concept guides, and exam/interview prep.
- **`slides/`**: Presentation slides summarizing the project.
- **`outputs/`**: Generated logs, plots, and execution results.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd c:\masai\MQ6_Adaptive_Perceptron_Concept_Drift
   ```
2. Run the Python script using `uv`:
   ```bash
   uv run python src/adaptive_perceptron_concept_drift.py
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   uv run jupyter notebook notebook/adaptive_perceptron_concept_drift.ipynb
   ```

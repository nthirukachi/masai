Capstone Overview
In this capstone, you will design an end-to-end AI pipeline to detect traffic congestion and road incidents using features derived from aerial camera feeds. The focus is on feature-level analysis, machine learning classification, and spatial risk visualization for intelligent traffic monitoring.
Dataset Provided
You are provided with a dataset containing tile-level traffic features extracted from aerial imagery. Each row corresponds to a road segment tile.
Features include average vehicle speed, vehicle density, lane occupancy, queue length, optical flow magnitude, edge density, time-of-day normalization, and illumination effects. Labels indicate normal traffic or congestion/incident conditions.
Objectives
Understand traffic flow indicators from aerial imagery
Apply machine learning for congestion detection
Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
Perform spatial aggregation and visualization
Interpret AI outputs for traffic management
Capstone Tasks
Task 1: Data Understanding
Explain the meaning of each feature and its relevance to traffic congestion.
Task 2: Machine Learning Model
Train and evaluate a classification model using precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC- AUC.

Task 3: Spatial Visualization
Generate traffic congestion heatmaps by aggregating predictions spatially.
Task 4: Traffic System Interpretation
Propose traffic management or emergency response actions based on results.
Task 5: Reflection
Discuss limitations and future improvements.

PROJECT REFLECTION AND LIMITATIONS
==================================================

LIMITATIONS OF THIS APPROACH:
-----------------------------
1. 📊 Dataset Size:
   - Small dataset may not capture all stress patterns
   - More data would improve model generalization

2. 🕐 Temporal Aspects:
   - Single time snapshot - no seasonal variation
   - Stress changes over time not captured

3. 🌍 Geographic Specificity:
   - Model trained on one field/region
   - May not transfer to different climates or crops

4. 🔬 Ground Truth:
   - Labels may have some uncertainty
   - Field validation not included

5. 🌱 Crop Type:
   - Single crop type assumed
   - Different crops have different index thresholds

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS:
----------------------
1. 📈 More Data:
   - Collect data across multiple seasons
   - Include multiple fields and crop types

2. 🛰️ Multi-temporal Analysis:
   - Track changes over time
   - Detect stress progression

3. 🔍 Additional Features:
   - Weather data integration
   - Soil sensor data
   - Historical yield data

4. 🤖 Advanced Models:
   - Try XGBoost, LightGBM for comparison
   - Deep learning for texture features
   - Ensemble methods for robustness

5. ✅ Validation:
   - Field verification of predictions
   - Agronomist expert review
   - A/B testing of recommendations

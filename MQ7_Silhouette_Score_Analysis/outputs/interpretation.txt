START INTERPRETATION
--------------------
Based on the analysis, the optimal number of clusters is likely **K=2** with a Silhouette Score of **0.360**.

1. **Inertia vs. Silhouette:** 
   - Inertia decreases as we add more clusters (which is expected).
   - However, the Silhouette Score peaks at K=2, indicating that at this point, the clusters are the most distinct and well-separated.

2. **Marketing Stakeholder Note:**
   - We have identified 2 distinct customer segments.
   - These groups likely represent behaviors such as "High Spenders," "Budget Conscious," etc.
   - We should tailor marketing strategies for each of these 2 groups specifically.

3. **Visual Confirmation:**
   - Please check 'silhouette_plot_k2.png'. You will see that the cluster "knives" (the shapes) are roughly equal in thickness and extend past the average line, which is a sign of good clustering.

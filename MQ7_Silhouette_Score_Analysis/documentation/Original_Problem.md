Evaluate Silhouette Score on Real Data [CODING]

Dataset: Use the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset from Kaggle (Mall Customer Segmentation Data – https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata – Mall_Customers.csv) or a comparable retail dataset with spending patterns.

Tasks:

    Engineer at least three numeric features and scale them.
    Run K-Means for K ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5}. Compute average silhouette score for each K and plot the results.
    Produce silhouette diagrams for the best-performing K.
    Compare silhouette scores with inertia values; explain any disagreements and note cluster characteristics driving the results.

Deliverables: Cleaned dataset, silhouette plots, comparison table (K vs inertia vs silhouette), 2–3 paragraph interpretation aimed at a marketing stakeholder.

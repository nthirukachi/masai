                "### Q1: Why does ReLU create angular decision boundaries?\n",
                "**Answer**: ReLU is defined as max(0, x), which is piecewise linear. For positive inputs, it's just the identity (y = x). This linearity means combinations of ReLU neurons create piecewise-linear decision boundaries.\n",

                "- When you need bounded outputs (use sigmoid for probability, tanh for normalized)\n",
                "- In RNNs/LSTMs (tanh traditionally used)\n",
                "- When \"dying ReLU\" is a problem (use LeakyReLU instead)\n",
                "\n",
                "### Q3: What is the vanishing gradient problem?\n",
                "**Answer**: Sigmoid/Tanh have gradients that approach 0 for large |x|. During backpropagation, these small gradients multiply, making learning very slow in early layers. ReLU solves this with constant gradient of 1 for x > 0.\n",

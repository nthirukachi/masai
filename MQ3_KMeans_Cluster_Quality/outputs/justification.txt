[JUSTIFICATION] FOR CHOOSING k=3
================================================================================

After evaluating K-Means with k from 2 to 6, we select k=3 as the 
optimal number of clusters. Here's why:

**COHESION (Inertia Analysis)**:
The elbow plot shows a clear bend at k=3. Inertia drops significantly 
from k=2 to k=3 (steep decline), then decreases more gradually 
(diminishing returns). This "elbow" indicates that k=3 provides 
good cluster tightness without overfitting.

**SEPARATION (Silhouette Analysis)**:
The silhouette score at k=3 is 0.4799, indicating good 
cluster separation. While k=2 achieves slightly higher silhouette (0.5818), 
it merges naturally distinct groups.

**DOMAIN INTUITION**:
The Iris dataset contains 3 actual flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, 
Virginica). Our analysis correctly identifies k=3, matching 
biological reality!

**BALANCE**:
k=3 optimally balances:
- Cohesion: Compact clusters (inertia=191.02)
- Separation: Well-distinguished groups (silhouette=0.4799)
- Interpretability: Matches known species count

# Perceptron From Scratch

This project implements a Perceptron (Single-Layer Neural Network) from scratch to predict student success (Pass/Fail) based on Study Hours and Attendance. It is designed as a strict teaching resource for complete beginners.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Run the Python Script
This will generate the plots in the `outputs/` folder and print the training results to the terminal.
```powershell
& c:/nagpython/demouv/.venv/Scripts/python.exe src/perceptron_scratch.py
```

### Option 2: Use the Jupyter Notebook
Open the notebook in VS Code or Jupyter Lab for a step-by-step interactive tutorial.
```
notebook/perceptron_scratch.ipynb
```

## 📚 Documentation Guide
- **Start Here**: Read `problem_statement.md` to understand the goal.
- **Deep Dive**: Read `concepts_explained.md` for a strict 12-point breakdown of every concept (Weights, Bias, Learning Rate, etc.).
- **Review**: Check `observations_and_conclusion.md` to understand the output diagrams.
- **Prep**: Use `interview_preparation.md` for exam revision.

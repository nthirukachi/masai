# Fraud Detection System using Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This project builds a fraud detection system for credit card transactions using various neural network architectures. It addresses the challenge of highly imbalanced data and experiments with different activation functions and network designs.

## Structure
- **notebook/**: Teaching-oriented Jupyter Notebooks.
- **src/**: Python source code.
- **documentation/**: Detailed explanations, concepts, and interview prep.
- **slides/**: Presentation slides.
- **outputs/**: Execution results and visualizations.

## Key Features
- Data Preprocessing (Scaling, SMOTE)
- Multiple Architectures (Shallow, Deep, Hybrid)
- Custom Activation Functions
- Comprehensive Evaluation
